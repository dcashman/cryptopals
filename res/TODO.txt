TODO's:
  * unit tests
  * replace references to '8' with class-defined value in header that is coupled with what's stored in vector
  * following-on from above, replace functions to deal with any-size storage (including get/setbits)
  * add B64 input to constructor
  * remove duplicated code for hex/B64 output printing
